# RedBlackTree
My own implementation of RedBlackTree data structure, without the functionality to remove nodes from the tree (to be added later).


### Prerequisite
Download and install [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)


### Execution
From commandline, navigate to the `src` folder

Compile [Main.java](./src/Main.java) and [RedBlackTree.java](./src/RedBlackTree.java) by typing `javac *.java`

Run [Main.java](./src/Main.java) by typing `java Main`

Then just follow the prompt to run. Red nodes are preceeded with the aterisk (*)
